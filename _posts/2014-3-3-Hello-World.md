An [adjunct](http://cunyadjunctproject.org/files/2009/03/main-points-and-discussion-questions.pdf) is a part-time non-tenure track professor. Like full-timers we have PhDs, MFAs, MBAs and JDs, yet we teach full courses for a fraction of the pay, have fewer benefits and zero job security. In 1975, the majority of [university faculty](https://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/Faculty_Trends_0.pdf) consisted of tenure and tenure-track professors. Today, it’s only 30%—and the percentage is declining. On average a tenured professor makes [$79,424](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/04/11/annual-aaup-salary-survey-says-professor-pay-34); plus benefits, research stipends, and job security.

Meanwhile, an adjunct averages [$3,000](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/02/05/college-work-forces-grew-not-fast-enrollment) per course, which for a full eight-course load a year pays around [$22,000-$25,000](https://www.npr.org/2013/09/22/224946206/adjunct-professor-dies-destitute-then-sparks-debate), often without benefits. To even accumulate enough courses to survive adjuncts teach at [multiple universities](https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2015/05/11/essay-instructor-who-has-taught-adjunct-25-years) each semester. While a tenured professor receives compensation whether or not a course runs, most adjuncts [aren’t compensated](http://www.newfacultymajority.info/facts-about-adjuncts/) when a course is canceled and are typically only informed of a course cancellation a couple days before the start of the semester after having prepared a syllabus and course material.
