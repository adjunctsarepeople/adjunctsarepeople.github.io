An [adjunct](http://cunyadjunctproject.org/files/2009/03/main-points-and-discussion-questions.pdf) is a part-time non-tenure track professor. Like full-timers we have PhDs, MFAs, MBAs, JDs, yet we teach full courses for a faction of the pay, have fewer benefits and zero job security. As of 2015 over [70%](https://www.forbes.com/sites/noodleeducation/2015/05/28/more-than-half-of-college-faculty-are-adjuncts-should-you-care/#32044be21600) university faculty are adjunctsâ€”that's a 50% increase in adjunct faculty and a 50% decrease in faculty investment in forty years. On average, an adjunct who teaches a full course load  will make between [$22,000 to $25,000](https://www.npr.org/2013/09/22/224946206/adjunct-professor-dies-destitute-then-sparks-debate) a year. Meanwhile, a full-time professor with the same workload will make around [$79,424](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/04/11/annual-aaup-salary-survey-says-professor-pay-34).
