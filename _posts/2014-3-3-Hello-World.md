An [adjunct](http://cunyadjunctproject.org/files/2009/03/main-points-and-discussion-questions.pdf) is a part-time non-tenure track professor. Like full-timers adjuncts have PhDs, MFAs, MBAs and JDs, yet teach full courses for a fraction of the pay, have fewer benefits and zero job security. In 1975, the majority of [university faculty](https://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/Faculty_Trends_0.pdf) consisted of tenure and tenure-track professors. Today, it’s only 30%—and the percentage is declining. On average a tenured professor makes [$79,424](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/04/11/annual-aaup-salary-survey-says-professor-pay-34); plus benefits, research stipends, and job security. Meanwhile, an adjunct averages [$3,000](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/02/05/college-work-forces-grew-not-fast-enrollment) per course, which for a full eight-course load a year pays around [$22,000-$25,000](https://www.npr.org/2013/09/22/224946206/adjunct-professor-dies-destitute-then-sparks-debate), often without benefits—professional support or even an office to meet with students. To accumulate enough courses to survive adjuncts teach at [multiple universities](https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2015/05/11/essay-instructor-who-has-taught-adjunct-25-years) each semester. While a tenured professor has a guaranteed course load and receives compensation whether or not a course runs, most adjuncts live semester to semester and [aren’t compensated](http://www.academicworkforce.org/CAW_portrait_2012.pdf) when a course is canceled. As tuition rises, universities are adding new [non-faculty](https://www.air.org/sites/default/files/downloads/report/DeltaCostAIR-Labor-Expensive-Higher-Education-Staffing-Brief-Feb2014.pdf) positions with competitive salaries and benefits packages. Why are universities divesting in professors? Simply put: because it’s more lucrative to spend the money on [frills](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/09/higher-education-college-adjunct-professor-salary/404461/) than on educators. Most students and parents don’t know what an adjunct is. And because adjuncts are just as dedicated and qualified, most never suspect their professor [sleeps in a car](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/09/higher-education-college-adjunct-professor-salary/404461/). 

[CUNY](http://www2.cuny.edu/about/) prides itself on providing world-class academics and award-winning faculty in a multitude of fields across 25 campuses. 
CUNY’s legislative mission is to be “of vital importance as a vehicle for the upward mobility of the disadvantaged in the City of New York.” Yet CUNY adjuncts make less than a [New Yorker](http://cunyadjunctproject.org/files/2009/10/equityweek.pdf) with only a high diploma. And when an adjunct does take off a year to pursue a Fulbright Fellowship—which CUNY celebrates on its subway ads—that adjunct loses access to health care and other benefits when they return. That adjunct then must rely on public assistance while they teach two courses per semester for one year in order to be eligible for health insurance. We are told the only way to tenure is to research, to write, to publish, to take risks—yet the sheer lack of job security makes academic inquiry virtually impossible to anyone who isn’t independently wealthy. Even so, it doesn’t matter how long you’ve been at CUNY, how talented you are at your field, or the quality of your reviews. There are no [guarantees](http://cunyadjunctproject.org/files/2009/10/equityweek.pdf). Adjuncts may find out a course has been canceled just a [couple days](http://psc-cuny.org/adjuncts-stories-job-insecurity) before the start of the semester, after having prepared a syllabus and course material. Not only will they not compensation, they may also immediately lose access to their health insurance. Should we have two courses at a single CUNY that do run, we will receive one paid [office hour](http://cunyadjunctproject.org/teaching-resources/#anchors1) per week. This means if you are teaching three literature courses, totaling 75 students, you only receive compensation for one hour of work outside the classroom. How are you expected to meet with students, prep, respond to a myriad of emails, provide feedback on the 225 essays (no including pre-writing and drafts) in one hour? The insinuation that one could even attempt to is offensive—especially when writing intensive courses require between 3-5 formal essays, with page requirements and a research component. The administration knows adjuncts are dedicated and they take advantage of the free labor. 

What is the solution? $7k per course and meaningful job security.
