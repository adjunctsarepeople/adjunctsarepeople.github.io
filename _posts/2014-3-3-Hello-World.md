An [adjunct](http://cunyadjunctproject.org/files/2009/03/main-points-and-discussion-questions.pdf) is a part-time non-tenure track professor. Like full-timers adjuncts have PhDs, MFAs, MBAs and JDs, yet teach full courses for a fraction of the pay, have fewer benefits and zero job security. In 1975, the majority of [university faculty](https://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/Faculty_Trends_0.pdf) consisted of tenure and tenure-track professors. Today, it’s only 30%—and the percentage is declining. On average a tenured professor makes [$79,424](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/04/11/annual-aaup-salary-survey-says-professor-pay-34); plus benefits, receives research stipends and has job security. Meanwhile, an adjunct averages [$3,000](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/02/05/college-work-forces-grew-not-fast-enrollment) per course, which for a full eight-course load pays around [$22,000-$25,000](https://www.npr.org/2013/09/22/224946206/adjunct-professor-dies-destitute-then-sparks-debate), often without benefits, professional support or even office space. To accumulate enough courses to survive, adjuncts teach at [multiple universities](https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2015/05/11/essay-instructor-who-has-taught-adjunct-25-years) each semester. While a tenured professor has a guaranteed course load and receives compensation whether or not a course runs, most adjuncts live semester to semester and [aren’t compensated](http://www.academicworkforce.org/CAW_portrait_2012.pdf) when a course is canceled. As tuition rises, universities are adding new [non-faculty](https://www.air.org/sites/default/files/downloads/report/DeltaCostAIR-Labor-Expensive-Higher-Education-Staffing-Brief-Feb2014.pdf) positions with competitive salaries and benefits packages. Universities have money! So, why are they divesting in professors? Simply put: because it’s more lucrative to spend the money on [frills](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/09/higher-education-college-adjunct-professor-salary/404461/) than on educators. Most students and parents don’t know what an adjunct is. And because adjuncts are just as dedicated and qualified, most never suspect their professor [sleeps in a car](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/09/higher-education-college-adjunct-professor-salary/404461/). 

[CUNY](http://www2.cuny.edu/about/) prides itself on offering world-class academics and award-winning faculty across its 25 campuses. 
CUNY’s legislative mission is to be “of vital importance as a vehicle for the upward mobility of the disadvantaged in the City of New York.” Yet the majority of CUNY's professors are adjuncts who make less than a [New Yorker](http://cunyadjunctproject.org/files/2009/10/equityweek.pdf) with only a high diploma. An adjunct who pursues a yearlong Fulbright Fellowship—which CUNY celebrates on its subway ads—loses access to health care and other benefits when they return to teach. Ironically, that adjunct who has just accomplished something that CUNY will use to boost its acclaim must now rely on public assistance for at least a year while they regain eligibility for health insurance. We are told the only way to tenure is to research, to write, to publish—yet the sheer lack of job security makes academic pursuits nearly impossible for anyone who isn’t independently wealthy. It doesn’t matter how long you’ve worked at CUNY, what an asset you are to your field, or the quality of your reviews. There are no [guarantees](http://cunyadjunctproject.org/files/2009/10/equityweek.pdf). Adjuncts may find out a course has been canceled just a [couple days](http://psc-cuny.org/adjuncts-stories-job-insecurity) before the start of the semester, after having prepared a syllabus and course material. Not only will they not be compensated for their work, they may also immediately lose their health insurance. Adjuncts who teach at least two classes at a single CUNY will receive one paid [office hour](http://cunyadjunctproject.org/teaching-resources/#anchors1) per week. This means if you are teaching three literature courses, totaling 75 students, you only receive compensation for one hour of work outside the classroom. How are you expected to meet with students, prep, respond to a myriad of emails, provide feedback on the 225 essays (no including pre-writing and drafts) in one hour per week? The insinuation that one could even attempt to do so is offensive—especially when writing intensive courses demand between 3-5 formal essays, with page requirements and a research component. The administration knows adjuncts are dedicated and they take advantage of the free labor. 

Adjuncts don’t need to stop whining or a get another job. This model of academia is not [sustainable](https://www.forbes.com/sites/noodleeducation/2015/05/28/more-than-half-of-college-faculty-are-adjuncts-should-you-care/#5aef34061600). Students who take classes from adjuncts are more likely to drop out and less likely to find professors to mentor them and write them recommendations. This isn’t because adjuncts are bad teachers—this is because they are simply spread too thin and do not last long. 

What is the solution? $7k per course and meaningful job security. This would mean adjuncts teaching full course loads would make between $42,000-$54,000.

CUNY has the [money](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/21/nyregion/city-college-of-new-york-president-investigation.html?_r=0). 

Paying adjuncts a living wage would not come at the expense of student financial aid.

Paying adjuncts a living wage would not mean adjunct jobs would be cut.

Paying adjuncts a living wage would mean less adjunct turnover and more long term support for students.

Paying adjuncts a living wage means adjuncts can take fewer side jobs and dedicate time to projects, writing and research.

Paying adjuncts a living wage and providing them with job security means academic freedom. 

Paying adjuncts a living wage and proving them with job security means an adjunct can afford to get sick.
